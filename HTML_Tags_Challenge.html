            <h1>Roller Coaster Attractions</h1>
            <p>A roller coaster is a brief thrill ride that carries passengers on an elevated railway with steep inclines and descents. Passengers ride in cars that are connected to form a train. The train moves through sharp curves and sudden changes of speed and direction. On most roller coasters, riders remain seated beneath a safety bar. However, variations include riders standing on a platform or being confined with over-the-shoulder restraints. Roller coasters are found mostly in amusement parks.</p>
